      <ul class="artwork-metadata"><li><strong>Location:</strong> <a href="../locations/Pompeii.html">Pompeii</a>, House of Terentius Neo (Regio VII, Insula 2, 6)</li>
<li><strong>Medium:</strong> Fresco</li>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> c. 50-79 CE</li></ul>
      
      <div class="description"><p>One of the finest Roman portrait frescoes to survive from antiquity, depicting a middle-class couple holding objects symbolizing literacy and education. The work was sometimes erroneously called the &quot;Portrait of Paquius Proculus&quot; due to confusion with another house.</p>
<p>The man, Terentius Neo, was a bakery owner. He wears a toga (mark of Roman citizenship) and holds a rotulus (scroll), suggesting involvement in public or cultural affairs. His wife holds a stylus and wax tablet, emphasizing her education and literacy.</p>
<p>The portrait is remarkable for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shows the couple as equals in status</li>
<li>Displays realistic imperfections and peculiarities in their faces</li>
<li>Represents a confident, fashionable mercantile class</li>
<li>Originally displayed beneath a smaller painting of Cupid and Psyche</li>
</ul>
