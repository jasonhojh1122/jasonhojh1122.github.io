      <ul class="artwork-metadata"><li><strong>Location:</strong> <a href="../locations/Pompeii.html">Pompeii</a>, House of the Golden Bracelet (VI.17.42), Oecus 32</li>
<li><strong>Medium:</strong> Fresco</li>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> c. 14-37 CE (Tiberian period, Third Style)</li></ul>
      
      <div class="description"><p>One of the most spectacular garden frescoes from the ancient world, originally covering all walls and the vaulted ceiling of a garden room (oecus). The painting depicts a lush paradise garden with remarkable botanical and ornithological detail.</p>
<p>The fresco features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plants</strong>: Oleander, viburnum, arbutus, bay, palm trees, irises, roses, daisies, and poppies</li>
<li><strong>Birds</strong>: Doves, house sparrows, swallows, golden orioles, and jays</li>
<li><strong>Decorative elements</strong>: A birdbath, herms supporting plaques showing sleeping women, and theater masks</li>
<li><strong>Structure</strong>: A black background socle with vegetal tufts, a cane fence with luxurious garden above, and an upper register with ornamental elements and architectural motifs</li>
</ul>
<p>The house was named for a gold bracelet (weighing 610 grams) found on the skeleton of a woman. Tragically, in 1974 casts revealed four people—a man, woman, and two small children—who died trapped beneath a staircase during the eruption&#39;s second day.</p>
<p>The frescoes were damaged in the eruption but fragments were discovered in 1980 in the volcanic debris. Restoration and reassembly continues.</p>
