      <div class="description"><p>The Cave Canem (&quot;Beware of the Dog&quot;) mosaic is one of the most famous images from ancient Pompeii. Located at the entrance of the House of the Tragic Poet, this black and white floor mosaic depicts a chained dog with the Latin inscription &quot;CAVE CANEM&quot; below it.</p>
<p>The mosaic served as both a practical warning to visitors and a decorative entrance feature. Such &quot;beware of dog&quot; mosaics were common in Roman homes and were believed to ward off evil spirits as well as protect homes from intruders.</p>
<p>The House of the Tragic Poet itself is a Roman house dating to the 2nd century BCE, famous for its elaborate mosaic floors and frescoes depicting scenes from Greek mythology. The house takes its name from a mosaic found in the tablinum depicting a theatrical rehearsal or choragus.</p>
