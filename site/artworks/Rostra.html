      <div class="description"><p>A large platform from which orators addressed the Roman people. The name comes from the ships&#39; prows (rostra) that decorated the front after a naval victory. Cicero delivered many of his famous speeches here, and after his murder, his head and hands were displayed on the Rostra. Mark Antony&#39;s funeral oration for Caesar was likely delivered from here.</p>
