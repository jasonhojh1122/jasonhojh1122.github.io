      <div class="description"><p>A monumental tomb featuring a contemplative seated figure of Lorenzo de&#39; Medici, Duke of Urbino, known as &quot;Il Pensieroso&quot; (The Thinker) for his meditative pose with his chin resting on his hand. The allegorical figures of Dawn and Dusk recline on the sarcophagus below.</p>
<p>Dawn is represented as a female figure awakening, her expression suggesting melancholy at the new day. Dusk is a weary male figure, also with an expression of profound sadness. Together with the companion tomb of Giuliano, the ensemble represents Michelangelo&#39;s meditation on time, death, and eternity.</p>
