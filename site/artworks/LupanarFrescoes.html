      <div class="description"><p>The Lupanar is the ruined building of an ancient Roman brothel in the city of Pompeii, also known as the Lupanare Grande or the &quot;Purpose-Built Brothel.&quot; It is of particular interest for the erotic paintings on its walls.</p>
<p>The frescoes above the doorways of each small room depict various erotic scenes. These paintings are believed to have served multiple purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a menu of services offered</li>
<li>As decoration</li>
<li>As stimulation for patrons</li>
<li>As a guide for those who did not speak the local language</li>
</ul>
<p>The building has ten small rooms (five on each floor) with stone beds that would have been covered with mattresses. Graffiti carved into the walls by both workers and clients provides additional historical insight into Roman society.</p>
<p>Pompeii was closely associated with Venus, the ancient Roman goddess of love, sex, and fertility, making the city a mythological figure closely tied to prostitution in the Roman world.</p>
