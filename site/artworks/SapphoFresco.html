      <div class="description"><p>A striking portrait of a finely dressed young woman with a writing tablet and stylus, symbols used in Roman painting to indicate literacy and education. The woman has short, curly brown hair, a gold hairnet, gold earrings, and clothes dyed purple and green.</p>
<p>She gazes directly at the viewer, holding a set of wax tablets bound with ribbons in her left hand while pressing a writing stylus to her lips in thoughtful contemplation.</p>
<p>The portrait was speculatively identified as the Greek poet Sappho in the 19th century, though no evidence supports this. Most modern scholars believe it depicts an educated, upper-class Pompeian woman. The fresco was discovered on 17 May 1760 alongside a panel depicting the myth of Andromeda and Perseus.</p>
<p>The fresco influenced the Chinese poet Shao Xunmei, who was inspired to take up poetry after seeing it in Naples in the early 1920s.</p>
