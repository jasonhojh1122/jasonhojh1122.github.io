      <div class="description"><p>Two famous polychrome mosaics depicting athletes and judges of competitions, discovered in 1824 in the exedrae on the east and west sides of the baths complex. The figures are divided into square panels with busts and rectangular panels with full-length figures. Athletes are shown with their hair gathered into a cirrus (characteristic knot at the nape of the neck).</p>
