      <div class="description"><p>The commission for Florence cathedral was originally assigned to Agostino di Duccio with a design by Donatello. When Donatello died, the stone was assigned to Michelangelo. The stone was tall but shallow and some work from Agostino had been done already.</p>
<p>The statue was designed to be placed on the Florence cathedral&#39;s buttress pedestals, on which the boy could look out over the city, gazing to the north. The statue was ultimately placed in front of Palazzo dei Priori (now Palazzo Vecchio).</p>
<p>The left arm and hand were damaged in 1527 and preserved by Vasari and Francesco Salviati. The original now stands in the Galleria dell&#39;Accademia, while a replica stands in its original location in Piazza della Signoria.</p>
