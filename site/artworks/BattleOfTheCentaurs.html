      <div class="description"><p>A marble relief depicting the mythological battle between the Lapiths and Centaurs, created when Michelangelo was about 17 and living in the household of Lorenzo de&#39; Medici. The dynamic composition of intertwined nude figures demonstrates his early interest in the human form in motion.</p>
<p>This was the last work Michelangelo created while under the patronage of Lorenzo de&#39; Medici, who died shortly after its completion. The subject was suggested to Michelangelo by the classical scholar and poet Poliziano, inspired by a classical relief created by Bertoldo di Giovanni. Though unfinished, it demonstrates Michelangelo&#39;s fascination with movement and human anatomy that would characterize his mature work.</p>
