      <ul class="artwork-metadata"><li><strong>Location:</strong> <a href="../locations/Pompeii.html">Pompeii</a>, House of the Tragic Poet (Regio VI, Insula 8, 3)</li>
<li><strong>Medium:</strong> Fresco</li>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> c. 30-79 CE (Fourth Style)</li></ul>
      
      <div class="description"><p>A masterful Fourth Style fresco from the peristyle of the House of the Tragic Poet. The composition shows a nude Iphigenia being taken by Ulysses and Achilles to be sacrificed.</p>
<p>Key elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Right side</strong>: Calchas the seer holds his hand to his mouth, indicating divine revelation</li>
<li><strong>Left side</strong>: Agamemnon sits facing away with his face veiled in grief</li>
<li><strong>Center</strong>: Iphigenia is dragged to the altar, with Clytemnestra grieving nearby</li>
<li><strong>Upper portion</strong>: Artemis and one of her Nymphs bring a stag to sacrifice in the girl&#39;s place</li>
</ul>
<p>The fresco is thought to be based on a celebrated lost painting by the Greek artist Timanthes. The detail of Agamemnon veiling his face to hide his grief became famous in antiquity for showing that some emotions are too powerful to depict directly.</p>
