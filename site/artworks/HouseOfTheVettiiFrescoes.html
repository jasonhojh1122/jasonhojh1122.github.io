<li><strong>Medium:</strong> Fresco</li>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> c. 62-79 CE (Fourth Style)</li></ul>
      
      <div class="description"><p>The House of the Vettii contains some of the finest examples of Fourth Style Roman wall painting found in Pompeii. The house is named for its owners, two successful freedmen: Aulus Vettius Conviva, an Augustalis, and Aulus Vettius Restitutus.</p>
<p>The frescoes were completed following the earthquake of 62 AD, in what art historians term the Pompeiian Fourth Style. This final style of Pompeian painting is characterized by elaborate architectural fantasies, theatrical scenes, and mythological narratives.</p>
<p>There are twelve mythological scenes across four cubiculum and one triclinium, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cupids and Psyches performing various trades</strong> - Depicting scenes of perfume-making, goldsmithing, baking, and oil production</li>
<li><strong>Ixion being bound to the wheel</strong> - A punishment scene from Greek mythology</li>
<li><strong>Daedalus presenting the wooden cow to Pasiphae</strong></li>
<li><strong>The infant Hercules strangling serpents</strong></li>
<li><strong>The punishment of Dirce</strong></li>
<li><strong>Priapus</strong> - The famous fresco at the entrance showing the god weighing his phallus</li>
</ul>
<p>The house was reopened to tourists in January 2023 after two decades of restoration.</p>
