      <div class="description"><p>The erotic frescoes in the apodyterium (changing room) of the Suburban Baths are unique in Roman art - the only known examples of explicit erotic imagery in a public bath house. Discovered in 1986, the eight scenes were painted on the southern wall against a yellow background, with corresponding numbered boxes (I-VIII) below for storing bathers&#39; clothing.</p>
<p>The scenes demonstrate refined artistic execution with careful use of shading and color gradation, suggesting a skilled painter. They depict a variety of sexual acts including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two male-female coital scenes</li>
<li>Fellatio and cunnilingus</li>
<li>A scene with two women (unique in Roman painting)</li>
<li>A threesome and foursome</li>
<li>A figure with exaggerated anatomy</li>
</ul>
<p>A second set of scenes (IX-XVI) existed on the eastern wall but was lost when the plaster collapsed during the eruption. The purpose of these paintings remains debated among scholars. Some theorize they served as advertisements for sexual services available on the upper floor, while others interpret them as humorous mnemonic devices helping bathers remember where they stored their belongings, or simply as decoration meant to create a relaxed atmosphere.</p>
<p>The frescoes remain in situ at the Suburban Baths in Pompeii.</p>
