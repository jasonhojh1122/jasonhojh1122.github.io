<p>A Roman family of seven members across four generations who were skilled architects, sculptors, and workers in decorative geometric mosaic. They specialized in a technique of opus sectile formed of elaborate inlays of small triangles and rectangles of colored stones and glass mosaics set into stone matrices. Their name is commemorated in the genre of &quot;Cosmatesque&quot; work. Initial inspiration for the technique was Byzantine, transmitted through Ravenna and Sicily, while some of the minutely-figured tiling patterns are Islamic in origin. Their work adorns many Roman churches including Santa Maria in Cosmedin, where the pavement, schola cantorum, pulpit, paschal candlestick, altar canopy, and episcopal throne all bear their distinctive style.</p>
