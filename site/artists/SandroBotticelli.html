<p>Alessandro di Mariano di Vanni Filipepi, better known as Sandro Botticelli, was an Italian painter of the Early Renaissance. Active in the shop of Verrocchio, along with young Leonardo da Vinci. His posthumous reputation suffered until the late 19th century, when he was rediscovered by the Pre-Raphaelites.</p>

Links to the Medici: the oranges are similar to the red palle (balls) in the Medici coat of arms. Flames on Mercury and Venus&#039; neck and breasts are the fires of St. Lawrence (Lorenzo).</p>
