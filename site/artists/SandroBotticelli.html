<p>Alessandro di Mariano di Vanni Filipepi, better known as Sandro Botticelli, was an Italian painter of the Early Renaissance. Active in the shop of Verrocchio, along with young Leonardo da Vinci. His posthumous reputation suffered until the late 19th century, when he was rediscovered by the Pre-Raphaelites.</p>

- The right, dark haired youth may be Giuliano, Lorenzo&#039;s brother
- The figure with gold-colored cloak on the right is believed to be Botticelli&#039;s self-portrait</p>

      <p class="description">Primavera means &quot;Spring.&quot; The painting depicts a mythological scene in a garden:
- At the right, the wind god Zephyrus pursues the virgin nymph Chloris. Chloris then transforms into Flora, goddess of Spring, shown to her left
- At the left, Mercury dispels the storm
- At the center stands Venus, goddess of Love, Beauty and Marriage

Links to the Medici: the oranges are similar to the red palle (balls) in the Medici coat of arms. Flames on Mercury and Venus&#039; neck and breasts are the fires of St. Lawrence (Lorenzo).</p>

      <p class="description">The strong emotions and color suggest Botticelli may have been a listener to Girolamo Savonarola, a monk from Ferrara who became the prior of San Marco. Savonarola was a preacher who advocated the destruction of secular art and culture, and was later tortured and executed.</p>
