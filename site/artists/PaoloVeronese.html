      <p class="description">One of the largest canvases of the 16th century (555 x 1,309 cm). Originally painted as a Last Supper for a Dominican friary, Veronese&#039;s irreverent interpretation led to an investigation by the Inquisition. Rather than make changes, he simply renamed the painting. A masterpiece of Venetian colorism.</p>
