      <p class="description">The altarpiece of the sacristy, originally painted for Santo Spirito in Isola. Saint Mark sits enthroned holding his gospel, flanked by Saints Cosmas and Damian (patron saints of physicians) on the left, and Saints Roch and Sebastian (saints invoked during plague) on the right. Thought to be Titian&#039;s first independent commission.</p>

      <p class="description">Titian&#039;s most famous painting, commissioned for the Basilica and remaining in its original position on the high altar.

      <p class="description">Located in the left nave, this revolutionary painting places the Madonna and Child dramatically off-center to the upper right rather than in the physical center. Commissioned by Bishop Jacopo Pesaro, this asymmetrical arrangement was highly innovative and influenced religious painting for generations.</p>

      <p class="description">One of three dramatic ceiling paintings, originally for Santo Spirito. Walter Friedlaender called these paintings &quot;manifestations of genius unprecedented even in Titian&#039;s own work&quot; for their impassioned power of movement and daring use of foreshortening. Highly influential on Baroque painting.</p>
