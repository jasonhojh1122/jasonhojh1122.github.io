      <p class="description">The altarpiece of the sacristy, originally painted for Santo Spirito in Isola. Saint Mark sits enthroned holding his gospel, flanked by Saints Cosmas and Damian (patron saints of physicians) on the left, and Saints Roch and Sebastian (saints invoked during plague) on the right. Thought to be Titian&#039;s first independent commission.</p>

      <p class="description">Titian&#039;s most famous painting, commissioned for the Basilica and remaining in its original position on the high altar. The largest altarpiece in Venice, with figures well over life-size. The work established Titian as the most prominent painter of 16th century Venice. Also known as the Assunta.</p>

      <p class="description">Located in the left nave, this revolutionary painting places the Madonna and Child dramatically off-center to the upper right rather than in the physical center. Commissioned by Bishop Jacopo Pesaro, this asymmetrical arrangement was highly innovative and influenced religious painting for generations.</p>

      <p class="description">A portrait of an unknown woman in a sumptuous blue dress, exemplifying the Renaissance ideal of female beauty. The sitter&#039;s identity is debated, though she may be the same model as Titian&#039;s Venus of Urbino. The work is documented in a 1536 letter from the Duke of Urbino describing &quot;that portrait of that woman in a blue dress.&quot; It hangs in the Sala di Venere.</p>

      <p class="description">A striking portrait of an unidentified young man with intense grey-blue eyes, traditionally but uncertainly identified as an Englishman. The sitter may be Henry Howard, Ottavio Farnese, or the Italian Ippolito Riminaldi. The painting is admired for its penetrating psychological insight and Titian&#039;s virtuosic handling of the rich dark costume against the grey background.</p>

      <p class="description">One of three dramatic ceiling paintings, originally for Santo Spirito. Walter Friedlaender called these paintings &quot;manifestations of genius unprecedented even in Titian&#039;s own work&quot; for their impassioned power of movement and daring use of foreshortening. Highly influential on Baroque painting.</p>

      <p class="description">A commanding portrait of the Renaissance poet and satirist Pietro Aretino, painted possibly for Cosimo I de&#039; Medici. Titian renders his friend in richly textured robes with bold, almost impressionistic brushwork. Aretino famously complained that the finish was too sketchy, yet the vigorous technique is now admired as proto-modern. Displayed in the Sala di Venere.</p>
