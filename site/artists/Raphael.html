      <div class="bio"><p><strong>Born</strong>: April 6, 1483, Urbino, Duchy of Urbino
<strong>Died</strong>: April 6, 1520, Rome, Papal States</p>
<p>Italian painter and architect of the High Renaissance. Together with Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, he forms the traditional trinity of great masters of that period. While Michelangelo was working on the first campaign of the Sistine Ceiling, Raphael arrived in Rome and rose to a level of power and wealth so high no other Italian artist had ever met, becoming the papal architect.</p>
<p>Studied under Pietro Perugino, whose influence is visible in his early works such as The Marriage of the Virgin.</p>

      <p class="description">The building depicted is not a real one but an invention. The statues in the left and right are Apollo and Minerva, gods of the arts and wisdom.

In the center stand Plato and Aristotle:
- **Aristotle** holds his Nicomachean Ethics, which stresses the rational nature of humanity and the need for moral behavior. His hand is placed horizontally to indicate the earth is the source for his observation.
- **Plato** holds his Timaeus, in which he describes the origin of the universe. He points upward to indicate that his ideas come from the realm of the mind.

Key figures identified:
- **Socrates** is in a green robe at the left of Plato
- **Pythagoras** at the lower left demonstrates his system of proportions
- **Ptolemy** at the extreme right contemplates a celestial globe
- **Euclid** at the left of Ptolemy bends down to draw a circle—this is a portrait of Bramante
- At the extreme right, **Raphael** painted a self-portrait looking out
- In the foreground sits a lonely man with 16th century stone cutter boots—a portrait of **Michelangelo**</p>
