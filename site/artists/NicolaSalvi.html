<p>Italian architect whose masterwork is the Trevi Fountain. He won the commission in 1732 after Pope Clement XII held a competition. Salvi spent nearly two decades designing and overseeing construction but died before its completion. His theatrical design integrates the fountain with the rear wall of Palazzo Poli, creating a dramatic backdrop that merges architecture and sculpture.</p>
