      <p class="description">Ghiberti&#039;s first masterpiece, made before his celebrated Gates of Paradise. The doors contain scenes from the New Testament in quatrefoil frames. After restoration in 2013-2015, the original doors were displayed in the Museo dell&#039;Opera del Duomo and replaced by a copy on the Baptistery. Created after Ghiberti won the famous competition against Brunelleschi.</p>

      <p class="description">A bronze statue commissioned by the cloth merchant&#039;s guild (Arte di Calimala). The first life-sized bronze cast in the Renaissance and the first bronze statue of its size to be cast in a single piece for several hundred years in Italy.

The artist&#039;s use of unnaturalistic but elegant curves in the hair and drapery of the saint show the influence of the International Gothic style prevalent in Italy at the time the work was created. The statue marks an important technical achievement in bronze casting and helped establish Ghiberti&#039;s reputation, leading to his famous commission for the Baptistery doors.</p>

      <p class="description">The second set of bronze doors Ghiberti created for the Baptistery, depicting Old Testament scenes in ten rectangular panels. Michelangelo reportedly said they were worthy of being the &quot;Gates of Paradise.&quot; The original panels are now displayed in glass cases in the Museo dell&#039;Opera del Duomo. Contains the first sensuous female nudes of the Renaissance.</p>
