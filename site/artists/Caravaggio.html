<p>Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio was an Italian painter whose dramatic use of chiaroscuro lighting had a formative influence on Baroque painting. He fled Rome after killing a man in 1606 and spent his final years in Naples, Malta, and Sicily. Six of his masterpieces are in the Galleria Borghese.</p>
