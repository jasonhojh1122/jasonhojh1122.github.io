<p>Jacopo Robusti, known as Tintoretto, was an Italian Renaissance painter of the Venetian school. His contemporaries both admired and criticized the speed with which he painted and the unprecedented boldness of his brushwork. For his phenomenal energy in painting he was termed &quot;il Furioso.&quot; His work is characterized by muscular figures, dramatic gestures and bold use of perspective.</p>
