      <p class="description">One of the large frescoes on the walls of the Salone dei Cinquecento, depicting the 1554 battle in which Florence defeated the Republic of Siena. This fresco contains the mysterious inscription &quot;Cerca Trova&quot; (Seek and You Shall Find), which some interpret as a hint that Leonardo&#039;s Battle of Anghiari may survive beneath.</p>

      <p class="description">A monumental fresco covering the interior of Brunelleschi&#039;s dome. Initially commissioned by Grand Duke Cosimo I de&#039; Medici, it was begun by Giorgio Vasari in 1572 and completed after his death by Federico Zuccari in 1579. The subject was inspired by Michelangelo&#039;s work on the Sistine Chapel ceiling. It was extensively restored between 1989 and 1994.</p>
