<p>Greek sculptor from the island of Rhodes, working in a late Hellenistic &quot;baroque&quot; style. Along with Athenodoros and Polydorus (likely relatives), he is credited with creating the Laocoön group and sculptures discovered at Sperlonga. The three sculptors signed both major works.</p>

      <p class="description">One of the most famous ancient sculptures, excavated in Rome in 1506 and displayed in the Vatican since then. The nearly life-sized group (over 2m high) depicts the Trojan priest Laocoön and his sons Antiphantes and Thymbraeus being attacked by sea serpents. Praised by Pliny the Elder as superior to any work of painting or sculpture.</p>
