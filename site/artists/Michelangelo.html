      <div class="bio"><p><strong>Born</strong>: March 6, 1475, Caprese Michelangelo
<strong>Died</strong>: February 18, 1564, Rome</p>
<p>Italian sculptor, painter, architect, and poet of the High Renaissance. Considered one of the greatest artists of all time. Unlike Leonardo who was skeptical and apolitical, Michelangelo was a believer and loyal Florentine. Where Leonardo looked on the world with detachment, Michelangelo was obsessed by guilt. Spare, taciturn, and irascible, yet consumed with a deep love for others that only in his old age was requited by the adoring reverence of his pupils.</p>
<p>Worked in Ghirlandaio&#39;s study at age 13, and was invited into the house of Lorenzo the Magnificent a year later. Scorned landscape, focusing on the human figure.</p>

      <p class="description">The first prophet to be painted on the Sistine Chapel ceiling. Isaiah turns away from the Flood, which is above and to his left, as if in answer to God&#039;s promise: &quot;For to Me this is like the days of Noah, when I swore that the waters of Noah would never again cover the earth. So I have sworn that I will not be angry with you or rebuke you.&quot; (Isaiah 54:9)

One of seven Old Testament prophets depicted on the ceiling, alternating with five sibyls (pagan prophetesses).</p>

      <p class="description">Completed in 29 days. The scene shows the devastating flood waters rising as people desperately seek safety. The father carries the body of his drowned son—a powerful image of loss and divine judgment. One of the central narrative panels on the Sistine Chapel ceiling.</p>

      <p class="description">Completed in 17 days. Painted after the successes of Julius II&#039;s army, with an increase in figure size compared to earlier scenes. God, absent from the first four scenes and standing on earth in the Creation of Eve, now moves through heaven in the last four scenes.

The near-touching fingers of God and Adam has become one of the most replicated religious images in history. The composition shows the reclining Adam receiving the spark of life from God, who floats in a billowing cloak surrounded by angels.</p>

      <p class="description">Completed in 13 days. Previously the Temptation and Expulsion had been depicted separately, but Michelangelo united them in the same fresco. On the left, Adam and Eve reach for the forbidden fruit offered by the serpent (depicted with a woman&#039;s torso); on the right, an angel drives them from Paradise. The contrast between their idealized bodies before the Fall and their aged, shamed forms after is striking.</p>

      <p class="description">One of the corner spandrels of the Sistine Chapel ceiling, depicting Old Testament scenes of salvation. Central interlocked figures create a clear narrative event—David is shown at the moment of striking down the giant Goliath. The dramatic composition emphasizes the physical struggle between the two figures.</p>

      <p class="description">One of five sibyls (pagan prophetesses) depicted on the Sistine Chapel ceiling, alternating with seven Old Testament prophets. The Libyan Sibyl is shown in a complex twisting pose, reaching for a large book. The light from the Separation of Light from Darkness falls onto the pages of the open book she holds.

The figure demonstrates Michelangelo&#039;s mastery of the human form, with powerful musculature visible beneath flowing drapery.</p>

      <p class="description">Completed in 7 days. Shows God creating the sun and moon with outstretched arms, commanding the celestial bodies into existence. In the same panel, God is shown a second time from behind, creating the plants. This dual depiction of God in one scene is a compositional innovation.</p>

      <p class="description">One of the last of Michelangelo&#039;s works on the ceiling, located in a corner spandrel. Shows more complex groupings of interlocking figures than earlier works. The Israelites writhe in agony from the serpent bites, while those who look upon the bronze serpent that Moses has raised are healed.

This scene was traditionally understood as a prefiguration of Christ&#039;s crucifixion, as referenced in John 3:14: &quot;As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.&quot;</p>

      <p class="description">Completed in 1 day—the fastest execution of any panel on the ceiling. The only scene that is presented as if viewed from below, with dramatic foreshortening of God&#039;s figure. This is the first act of creation, showing God&#039;s hands separating the primordial light from darkness.</p>

      <p class="description">Moses holds the Tablets of the Law. Part of the tomb of Pope Julius II, though the tomb was never completed as originally designed. The left arm repeats almost the same pose as the Cumaean Sibyl in the Sistine Chapel. The face looks similar to the God figure in the Creation of Sun, Moon and Plants in the Sistine Chapel.

The horns on Moses&#039; head derive from a mistranslation in the Latin Vulgate Bible, where the Hebrew word for &quot;rays of light&quot; was rendered as &quot;horns&quot; (cornuta). Moses is depicted at the moment of descending from Mount Sinai, about to discover the Israelites worshipping the Golden Calf.</p>
