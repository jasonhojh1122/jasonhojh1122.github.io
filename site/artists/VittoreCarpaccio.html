      <div class="bio"><p><strong>Born</strong>: c. 1465, Venice
<strong>Died</strong>: c. 1526, Venice</p>
<p>Italian painter of the Venetian school who studied under Gentile Bellini. Largely influenced by the style of Antonello da Messina, as well as Early Netherlandish painting. His command of perspective, precise attention to architectural detail, themes of death, and use of bold color differentiated him from other Italian Renaissance artists.</p>

      <p class="description">A famous painting showing two unknown Venetian ladies on a terrace with dogs, birds, and various symbolic objects. Believed to be a quarter of the original work; the top portion, called Hunting on the Lagoon, is now in the Getty Museum. Once thought to depict courtesans, the work is now believed to show two patrician women awaiting the return of their husbands from a hunting expedition.</p>
