      <p class="description">A marble statue standing approximately 7 ft 9 in (2.36 m) high, commissioned by the linen-drapers&#039; guild (Arte dei Linaioli e Rigattieri). It depicts Mark the Evangelist with extraordinary naturalism in the drapery and pose. The figure stands in a confident contrapposto, with weight shifted to one leg, creating a sense of life and movement.

The statue originally was displayed in an exterior niche of the church, where a copy now stands. The original has been moved inside the building, which is now a museum. Michelangelo reportedly said that he had &quot;never seen a figure with more of the appearance of a good man than this.&quot;</p>

      <p class="description">The Marzocco is the heraldic lion that is a symbol of Florence. Donatello&#039;s version was apparently the first piece of public secular sculpture commissioned by the Republic of Florence, in the late 14th century. The lion originally stood at the heart of the city in the Piazza della Signoria at the end of the platform attached to the Palazzo Vecchio called the ringhiera, from which speakers traditionally harangued the crowd.

This iconic representation of Florentine civic pride holds a shield bearing the lily emblem of Florence. The original is now in the Bargello, with a copy in the original location.</p>

      <p class="description">A marble statue commissioned for Giotto&#039;s Campanile. The popular name &quot;Zuccone&quot; (pumpkin) refers to the figure&#039;s bald head. Though traditionally identified as the prophet Habakkuk, Vasari suggests it may be a portrait of Giovanni di Barduccio Cherichini. The sculpture demonstrates Donatello&#039;s mastery of psychological realism and expressive characterization.</p>

      <p class="description">Donatello&#039;s final works, these two bronze pulpits in the nave of San Lorenzo depict the Passion and Resurrection of Christ with remarkable emotional intensity. The reliefs show scenes including the Crucifixion, Lamentation, Entombment, and Resurrection.

The pulpits were completed by Donatello&#039;s workshop after his death in 1466, and some scholars believe the finish shows hands other than the master&#039;s. The expressive, almost tortured style of these late works differs markedly from Donatello&#039;s earlier, more classical manner. Donatello is buried in San Lorenzo, near Cosimo de&#039; Medici, his longtime patron.</p>
