        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <div class="summary"><p>The Story of Noah recounts the great flood sent by God to cleanse the earth of wickedness and Noah&#39;s role in preserving life. Finding Noah to be a righteous man, God instructed him to build an ark and bring aboard his family and pairs of every living creature. The flood covered the entire earth for forty days and nights, destroying all life except those on the ark. When the waters receded, Noah released a dove that returned with an olive branch, signaling dry land. God established a covenant with Noah, symbolized by the rainbow, promising never again to destroy the earth by flood.</p>
