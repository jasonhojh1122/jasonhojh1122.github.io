        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <div class="summary"><p>The Last Supper depicts Jesus&#39;s final meal with his twelve disciples before his crucifixion, during which he instituted the Eucharist. Jesus told his disciples that one of them would betray him, and identified Judas as the betrayer. He then took bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to them saying &quot;This is my body.&quot; He also took a cup of wine saying &quot;This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.&quot; This event is commemorated in the Christian sacrament of Communion.</p>

      <p class="description">Considered the first &quot;Last Supper&quot; of the Renaissance in Florence, located in the refectory of the former Benedictine convent of Sant&#039;Apollonia. Judas is depicted sitting separately on the near side of the table, unlike all the other apostles.

The fresco is notable for its perspective illusion, as if the scene was happening in a small room and the viewer was observing from outside. The highly detailed marble walls hearken back to Roman &quot;First Style&quot; wall paintings. Saint John&#039;s posture of innocent slumber neatly contrasts with Judas&#039;s tense, upright pose.

The fresco was hidden behind plaster for over a century because the convent was cloistered. Vasari did not know of its existence. It may have influenced Leonardo da Vinci&#039;s later version, painted about 50 years later.</p>

      <p class="description">One of the largest canvases of the 16th century (555 x 1,309 cm). Originally painted as a Last Supper for a Dominican friary, Veronese&#039;s irreverent interpretation led to an investigation by the Inquisition. Rather than make changes, he simply renamed the painting. A masterpiece of Venetian colorism.</p>
