        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <div class="summary"><p>The Presentation in the Temple depicts the ritual presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem, forty days after his birth, in accordance with Jewish law (Leviticus 12). Mary and Joseph brought Jesus to the Temple along with an offering of &quot;a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.&quot; There they encountered Simeon, a devout man who had been promised he would not die until he had seen the Messiah. Taking Jesus in his arms, Simeon praised God with the words known as the Nunc Dimittis: &quot;Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace.&quot;</p>
