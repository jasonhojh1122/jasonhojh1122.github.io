        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <div class="summary"><p>The Creation of Adam depicts God creating the first man. According to Genesis, God formed Adam from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, making him a living being. God then placed Adam in the Garden of Eden to tend and keep it. This foundational story establishes humanity&#39;s special relationship with God and the beginning of human history.</p>

      <p class="description">Located in the south cupola of the west narthex, these mosaics depict the Creation story from Genesis. The designs were influenced by the Cotton Genesis, a 4th-5th century illuminated manuscript brought from Constantinople. The cycle continues with scenes of Noah, Abraham, Joseph, and Moses in adjacent cupolas.</p>

      <p class="description">Completed in 17 days. Painted after the successes of Julius II&#039;s army, with an increase in figure size compared to earlier scenes. God, absent from the first four scenes and standing on earth in the Creation of Eve, now moves through heaven in the last four scenes.

The near-touching fingers of God and Adam has become one of the most replicated religious images in history. The composition shows the reclining Adam receiving the spark of life from God, who floats in a billowing cloak surrounded by angels.</p>

      <p class="description">Completed in 7 days. Shows God creating the sun and moon with outstretched arms, commanding the celestial bodies into existence. In the same panel, God is shown a second time from behind, creating the plants. This dual depiction of God in one scene is a compositional innovation.</p>

      <p class="description">Completed in 1 day—the fastest execution of any panel on the ceiling. The only scene that is presented as if viewed from below, with dramatic foreshortening of God&#039;s figure. This is the first act of creation, showing God&#039;s hands separating the primordial light from darkness.</p>
