        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <div class="summary"><p>The Incredulity of Saint Thomas refers to the episode in the Gospel of John where the Apostle Thomas refused to believe that Jesus had risen from the dead until he could see and touch Christ&#39;s crucifixion wounds. This episode gave rise to the term &quot;Doubting Thomas.&quot;</p>
<p>When the resurrected Jesus appeared to the disciples, Thomas was absent. He declared, &quot;Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.&quot; A week later, Jesus appeared again and invited Thomas to touch his wounds, leading to Thomas&#39;s declaration of faith: &quot;My Lord and my God!&quot;</p>
