        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <div class="summary"><p>The punishment of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram recounts a rebellion against the leadership of Moses and Aaron during the Israelites&#39; wilderness wanderings. Korah, a Levite, along with Dathan, Abiram, and 250 community leaders, challenged Moses&#39; authority, claiming that all the congregation was holy and questioning why Moses exalted himself. God&#39;s punishment was swift and dramatic: the earth opened and swallowed Korah, Dathan, Abiram, and their households, while fire from the Lord consumed the 250 men who offered incense. The story served as a warning against challenging divinely appointed authority.</p>
