        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <div class="summary"><p>The Crucifixion depicts the death of Jesus Christ on the cross at Golgotha (also called Calvary). After being condemned by Pontius Pilate, Jesus was scourged, crowned with thorns, and forced to carry his cross to the place of execution. He was crucified between two criminals. During the crucifixion, darkness covered the land for three hours, and at the moment of his death, Jesus cried out &quot;It is finished.&quot; The temple veil was torn in two, and an earthquake occurred. A Roman centurion declared &quot;Truly this was the Son of God.&quot; This central event in Christian theology represents Christ&#39;s sacrifice for the redemption of humanity&#39;s sins.</p>
