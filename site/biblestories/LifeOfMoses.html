        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <div class="summary"><p>The life of Moses encompasses his birth in Egypt during Pharaoh&#39;s persecution of the Israelites, his adoption by Pharaoh&#39;s daughter, his flight to Midian after killing an Egyptian, and his calling at the burning bush to lead the Israelites out of slavery. God appeared to Moses in a bush that burned but was not consumed, revealing the divine name and commissioning Moses to confront Pharaoh. Through ten plagues and the parting of the Red Sea, Moses led the Exodus from Egypt. He received the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai and guided the Israelites through forty years in the wilderness.</p>
