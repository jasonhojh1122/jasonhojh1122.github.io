        <div class="summary"><p>The young shepherd David, armed only with a sling and stones, defeats the giant Philistine warrior Goliath in single combat. David&#39;s victory over seemingly impossible odds became a symbol of faith triumphing over brute strength and the underdog defeating a powerful enemy.</p>

      <p class="description">The commission for Florence cathedral was originally assigned to Agostino di Duccio with a design by Donatello. When Donatello died, the stone was assigned to Michelangelo. The stone was tall but shallow and some work from Agostino had been done already.

The statue was designed to be placed on the Florence cathedral&#039;s buttress pedestals, on which the boy could look out over the city, gazing to the north. The statue was ultimately placed in front of Palazzo dei Priori (now Palazzo Vecchio).

The left arm and hand were damaged in 1527 and preserved by Vasari and Francesco Salviati. The original now stands in the Galleria dell&#039;Accademia, while a replica stands in its original location in Piazza della Signoria.</p>

      <p class="description">One of the corner spandrels of the Sistine Chapel ceiling, depicting Old Testament scenes of salvation. Central interlocked figures create a clear narrative event—David is shown at the moment of striking down the giant Goliath. The dramatic composition emphasizes the physical struggle between the two figures.</p>

      <p class="description">One of three dramatic ceiling paintings, originally for Santo Spirito. Walter Friedlaender called these paintings &quot;manifestations of genius unprecedented even in Titian&#039;s own work&quot; for their impassioned power of movement and daring use of foreshortening. Highly influential on Baroque painting.</p>
