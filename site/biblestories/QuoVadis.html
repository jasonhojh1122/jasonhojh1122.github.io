        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <div class="summary"><p>&quot;Quo vadis?&quot; (Latin for &quot;Where are you going?&quot;) is a phrase from the apocryphal Acts of Peter. According to the legend, while fleeing Rome during Nero&#39;s persecution, the apostle Peter encountered a vision of Christ on the Appian Way. Peter asked &quot;Domine, quo vadis?&quot; (Lord, where are you going?), and Christ replied &quot;Romam vado iterum crucifigi&quot; (I am going to Rome to be crucified again). Ashamed, Peter returned to Rome where he was martyred by crucifixion (upside down at his request, considering himself unworthy to die in the same manner as Christ).</p>
