      <p class="description">A retractable awning system that stretched over the Colosseum&#039;s seating area to protect spectators from the sun. Supported by wooden masts socketed into the uppermost level of the structure, it was operated by a detachment of sailors from the Roman naval fleet. Evidence of the mounting brackets remains visible on the Colosseum today.</p>

      <p class="description">A large monumental conical fountain that once stood near the Colosseum in ancient Rome. The fountain &quot;sweated&quot; water from its surface, hence the name. Its remains were visible until 1936 when they were demolished during Mussolini&#039;s urban renewal of the area.</p>

      <p class="description">A 30-metre (98 ft) bronze statue originally created as a portrait of Emperor Nero in the vestibule of his Domus Aurea. Later modified by Nero&#039;s successors into a statue of the sun god Sol, it was moved to a spot outside the Flavian Amphitheatre, which became known as the Colosseum by its proximity to the Colossus. The statue no longer survives.</p>

      <p class="description">Originally 156 statues of gods, heroes, and demigods were placed in the outer arcades of the 2nd and 3rd tiers of the Colosseum. Prominent Romans had their portraits displayed on the 1st tier, while the imperial family&#039;s portraits adorned the imperial box. None of these statues survive today; their existence is documented through the reliefs from the [Tomb of the Haterii](TombOfTheHaterii.md) and ancient coins.</p>
