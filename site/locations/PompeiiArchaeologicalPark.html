      <p class="description">More than fifty examples of graffiti referring to Virgil have been found in Pompeii, with the majority quoting the opening lines of Book 1 or Book 2 of the Aeneid. Scholar Mary Beard suggests these lines may have been widely known in the same way &quot;To be, or not to be&quot; is recognized today—evidence of basic literacy and cultural education among ordinary Romans.</p>

      <p class="description">A well-preserved suburban villa on the outskirts of Pompeii, famous for the series of exquisite frescoes in Room 5. The paintings are usually interpreted as showing the initiation of a bride into the Dionysian Mysteries, a Greco-Roman mystery cult. These are among the best known survivals of ancient Roman painting from the 1st century BC, executed in the Second Style.</p>

      <p class="description">Located in the apodyterium (dressing room) of the Suburban Baths near Porta Marina, these are the only set of erotic wall paintings found in a public Roman bath house. Seven sexual scenes and one figure with an enlarged scrotum are depicted above numbered boxes, possibly serving as a humorous method for reminding bathers where they left their clothes. Discovered in 1986.</p>

      <p class="description">Over 150 graffiti inscriptions have been transcribed from Pompeii&#039;s most famous brothel. The texts include greetings, boasts, poems, death notices, and compliments in Latin, Greek, and native Oscan. The presence of graffiti served as one of the criteria for identifying the building as a brothel. These inscriptions provide insight into the multilingual nature of Roman Pompeii and the demographics of those who frequented such establishments.</p>

      <p class="description">The excavations of Pompeii and Herculaneum revealed cities rich in erotic artifacts including statues, frescoes, and household items decorated with sexual themes. The ubiquity of such imagery indicates that Roman attitudes toward sexual iconography were more relaxed than in modern Western culture. Much erotic art was also associated with fertility and religious practices related to Venus, the divine protector of Pompeii.</p>
