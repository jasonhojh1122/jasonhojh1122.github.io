      <p class="description">A well-preserved suburban villa on the outskirts of Pompeii, famous for the series of exquisite frescoes in Room 5. The paintings are usually interpreted as showing the initiation of a bride into the Dionysian Mysteries, a Greco-Roman mystery cult. These are among the best known survivals of ancient Roman painting from the 1st century BC, executed in the Second Style.</p>
