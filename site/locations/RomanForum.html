      <p class="description">An ancient circular temple (tholos) located near the Regia and the [House of the Vestals](HouseOfTheVestals.md). The temple housed Vesta&#039;s sacred fire, which was a symbol of Rome&#039;s safety and prosperity and was tended by the [Vestal Virgins](../terms.md#vestal-virgin). The fire was never allowed to go out; its extinction was seen as a portent of disaster for Rome.</p>

Three elegant Corinthian columns remain standing, among the most iconic images of the Roman Forum. The temple served as a meeting place for the Roman Senate and as a depository for weights and measures.</p>

Built on the spot where Caesar&#039;s body was cremated after his assassination in 44 BC. The altar marks where Mark Antony delivered his famous funeral oration. Romans still leave flowers on the altar today in tribute to Caesar.</p>

      <p class="description">An ancient Roman temple located on the Via Sacra, opposite the Regia. Built by Emperor Antoninus Pius in honor of his deified wife Faustina the Elder, and later also dedicated to the deified Antoninus. Later converted into the Roman Catholic church of San Lorenzo in Miranda, resulting in an exceptionally preserved temple front with massive columns and a complete entablature bearing the original Latin dedication.</p>

      <p class="description">A large platform from which orators addressed the Roman people. The name comes from the ships&#039; prows (rostra) that decorated the front after a naval victory. Cicero delivered many of his famous speeches here, and after his murder, his head and hands were displayed on the Rostra. Mark Antony&#039;s funeral oration for Caesar was likely delivered from here.</p>

      <p class="description">A two-part structure along the Via Sacra that originally served as the residence or headquarters of the Roman kings, later becoming the office of the pontifex maximus (chief priest). Only foundations remain. Archaeological excavations have revealed multiple layers of rebuilding, making this one of the most important sites for understanding early Roman history.</p>

The site contains one of the oldest known Latin inscriptions (Cippus of the Lapis Niger), dating to the 6th or 5th century BC.

      <p class="description">The third named [curia](../terms.md#curia), or senate house, in ancient Rome. Julius Caesar began construction to replace the earlier Curia Cornelia as part of his redesign of the Forum. The building&#039;s remarkably well-preserved brick exterior survives because it was converted into the church of Sant&#039;Adriano al Foro in the 7th century. The interior retains its original marble floor in opus sectile and contains the Plutei of Trajan, important relief sculptures.</p>

The three-story marble structure was one of the largest buildings in the Forum. Today only the foundations, steps, and a few column bases and brick piers remain. Game boards scratched into the marble steps by bored Romans can still be seen.</p>

      <p class="description">A 1st-century AD honorific arch located on the Via Sacra, just to the south-east of the Roman Forum. Constructed by Emperor Domitian shortly after the death of his older brother Titus to commemorate Titus&#039;s official deification and the victory over the Jewish rebellion in Judaea. The inner panels contain famous reliefs depicting the spoils of Jerusalem, including the Menorah being carried in triumph. It served as the model for many later triumphal arches including the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.</p>
