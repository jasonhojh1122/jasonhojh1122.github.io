      <p class="description">A drawing depicting a nude man in two superimposed positions inscribed within a circle and square, illustrating ideal human proportions as described by the Roman architect Vitruvius. Justly ranked among the all-time iconic images of Western civilization. Due to its fragility, displayed only every 4-6 years.</p>

      <p class="description">A mysterious Renaissance painting originally commissioned by Venetian noble Gabriele Vendramin. Depicts a soldier and a nursing woman in a lush landscape with a city threatened by a storm. Despite considerable scholarly discussion, the meaning remains elusive. Considered by some the first true landscape in Western art.</p>

      <p class="description">One of the largest canvases of the 16th century (555 x 1,309 cm). Originally painted as a Last Supper for a Dominican friary, Veronese&#039;s irreverent interpretation led to an investigation by the Inquisition. Rather than make changes, he simply renamed the painting. A masterpiece of Venetian colorism.</p>

      <p class="description">One of Titian&#039;s last paintings, left incomplete at his death in 1576 and finished by Palma Giovane. Titian intended it for his own grave. A profoundly moving late work demonstrating the artist&#039;s loose, expressive brushwork in his final years.</p>
