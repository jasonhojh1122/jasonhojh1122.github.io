      <p class="description">A striking portrait of a finely dressed young woman with a writing tablet and stylus, symbols used in Roman painting to indicate literacy and education. The woman has short, curly brown hair, a gold hairnet, gold earrings, and clothes dyed purple and green.

She gazes directly at the viewer, holding a set of wax tablets bound with ribbons in her left hand while pressing a writing stylus to her lips in thoughtful contemplation.

The portrait was speculatively identified as the Greek poet Sappho in the 19th century, though no evidence supports this. Most modern scholars believe it depicts an educated, upper-class Pompeian woman. The fresco was discovered on 17 May 1760 alongside a panel depicting the myth of Andromeda and Perseus.

The fresco influenced the Chinese poet Shao Xunmei, who was inspired to take up poetry after seeing it in Naples in the early 1920s.</p>

      <p class="description">A masterful Fourth Style fresco from the peristyle of the House of the Tragic Poet. The composition shows a nude Iphigenia being taken by Ulysses and Achilles to be sacrificed.

Key elements:
- **Right side**: Calchas the seer holds his hand to his mouth, indicating divine revelation
- **Left side**: Agamemnon sits facing away with his face veiled in grief
- **Center**: Iphigenia is dragged to the altar, with Clytemnestra grieving nearby
- **Upper portion**: Artemis and one of her Nymphs bring a stag to sacrifice in the girl&#039;s place

The fresco is thought to be based on a celebrated lost painting by the Greek artist Timanthes. The detail of Agamemnon veiling his face to hide his grief became famous in antiquity for showing that some emotions are too powerful to depict directly.</p>

      <p class="description">One of the finest Roman portrait frescoes to survive from antiquity, depicting a middle-class couple holding objects symbolizing literacy and education. The work was sometimes erroneously called the &quot;Portrait of Paquius Proculus&quot; due to confusion with another house.

The man, Terentius Neo, was a bakery owner. He wears a toga (mark of Roman citizenship) and holds a rotulus (scroll), suggesting involvement in public or cultural affairs. His wife holds a stylus and wax tablet, emphasizing her education and literacy.

The portrait is remarkable for several reasons:
- Shows the couple as equals in status
- Displays realistic imperfections and peculiarities in their faces
- Represents a confident, fashionable mercantile class
- Originally displayed beneath a smaller painting of Cupid and Psyche</p>

      <p class="description">The Lupanar is the ruined building of an ancient Roman brothel in the city of Pompeii, also known as the Lupanare Grande or the &quot;Purpose-Built Brothel.&quot; It is of particular interest for the erotic paintings on its walls.

The frescoes above the doorways of each small room depict various erotic scenes. These paintings are believed to have served multiple purposes:

- As a menu of services offered
- As decoration
- As stimulation for patrons
- As a guide for those who did not speak the local language

The building has ten small rooms (five on each floor) with stone beds that would have been covered with mattresses. Graffiti carved into the walls by both workers and clients provides additional historical insight into Roman society.

Pompeii was closely associated with Venus, the ancient Roman goddess of love, sex, and fertility, making the city a mythological figure closely tied to prostitution in the Roman world.</p>

      <p class="description">The House of the Vettii contains some of the finest examples of Fourth Style Roman wall painting found in Pompeii. The house is named for its owners, two successful freedmen: Aulus Vettius Conviva, an Augustalis, and Aulus Vettius Restitutus.

The frescoes were completed following the earthquake of 62 AD, in what art historians term the Pompeiian Fourth Style. This final style of Pompeian painting is characterized by elaborate architectural fantasies, theatrical scenes, and mythological narratives.

There are twelve mythological scenes across four cubiculum and one triclinium, including:

- **Cupids and Psyches performing various trades** - Depicting scenes of perfume-making, goldsmithing, baking, and oil production
- **Ixion being bound to the wheel** - A punishment scene from Greek mythology
- **Daedalus presenting the wooden cow to Pasiphae**
- **The infant Hercules strangling serpents**
- **The punishment of Dirce**
- **Priapus** - The famous fresco at the entrance showing the god weighing his phallus

The house was reopened to tourists in January 2023 after two decades of restoration.</p>

      <p class="description">One of the most spectacular garden frescoes from the ancient world, originally covering all walls and the vaulted ceiling of a garden room (oecus). The painting depicts a lush paradise garden with remarkable botanical and ornithological detail.

The fresco features:
- **Plants**: Oleander, viburnum, arbutus, bay, palm trees, irises, roses, daisies, and poppies
- **Birds**: Doves, house sparrows, swallows, golden orioles, and jays
- **Decorative elements**: A birdbath, herms supporting plaques showing sleeping women, and theater masks
- **Structure**: A black background socle with vegetal tufts, a cane fence with luxurious garden above, and an upper register with ornamental elements and architectural motifs

The house was named for a gold bracelet (weighing 610 grams) found on the skeleton of a woman. Tragically, in 1974 casts revealed four people—a man, woman, and two small children—who died trapped beneath a staircase during the eruption&#039;s second day.

The frescoes were damaged in the eruption but fragments were discovered in 1980 in the volcanic debris. Restoration and reassembly continues.</p>

      <p class="description">The Dionysiac Frieze is a series of exquisite frescoes in Room 5 of the Villa of the Mysteries, a well-preserved suburban ancient Roman villa on the outskirts of Pompeii. These paintings are among the best known of the relatively rare survivals of Ancient Roman painting from the 1st century BC.

The frescoes depict a continuous narrative that wraps around the walls of the room. They are usually interpreted as showing the initiation of a bride into a Greco-Roman mystery cult, likely the cult of Dionysus (Bacchus). The scenes include:

- A young woman reading a ritual text
- Preparation of a ritual meal
- A satyr playing a lyre
- A startled woman fleeing
- The unveiling of a sacred object
- A winged figure preparing to strike with a whip
- A woman being comforted after flagellation
- A dancing Maenad
- The dressing of the bride

The frieze is painted on a characteristic Pompeian red background and demonstrates the sophisticated Second Style of Roman wall painting.</p>

      <p class="description">A powerful Fourth Style fresco depicting the violent climax of the Pentheus myth. The scene shows Pentheus being discovered and attacked by the maenads (female followers of Dionysus).

Key elements:
- **Center**: A maenad holds a stone above her head, about to hurl it at Pentheus
- **Figures**: Pentheus&#039;s mother Agave and aunts Ino and Autonoë participate in the killing
- **Upper corners**: Two Erinyes (Furies) appear, with one raising a whip
- **Composition**: Shows the moment of recognition and initial attack

The fresco serves as a moral warning about the consequences of defying the gods. It is one of twelve surviving mythological panels in the House of the Vettii, believed to be copied from Greek models.

The House of the Vettii was owned by two freedmen brothers and features some of the finest Fourth Style frescoes in Pompeii.</p>

      <p class="description">The Cave Canem (&quot;Beware of the Dog&quot;) mosaic is one of the most famous images from ancient Pompeii. Located at the entrance of the House of the Tragic Poet, this black and white floor mosaic depicts a chained dog with the Latin inscription &quot;CAVE CANEM&quot; below it.

The mosaic served as both a practical warning to visitors and a decorative entrance feature. Such &quot;beware of dog&quot; mosaics were common in Roman homes and were believed to ward off evil spirits as well as protect homes from intruders.

The House of the Tragic Poet itself is a Roman house dating to the 2nd century BCE, famous for its elaborate mosaic floors and frescoes depicting scenes from Greek mythology. The house takes its name from a mosaic found in the tablinum depicting a theatrical rehearsal or choragus.</p>

      <p class="description">The Alexander Mosaic, also known as the Battle of Issus Mosaic, is a Roman floor mosaic originally from the House of the Faun in Pompeii, Italy. It depicts the Battle of Issus (333 BCE) between Alexander the Great and King Darius III of Persia.

The mosaic is composed of approximately 1.5 million tesserae (small colored tiles) and measures approximately 5.82 x 3.13 meters. It is believed to be a copy of a Greek painting, possibly by Philoxenus of Eretria or Apelles.

The dramatic composition shows the moment when Alexander, on horseback at the left, charges toward Darius, who is shown in his war chariot with an expression of alarm. The Persian king&#039;s charioteer is already turning the horses to flee.

A replica is displayed at the House of the Faun in Pompeii, while the original is housed in the Naples National Archaeological Museum.</p>
