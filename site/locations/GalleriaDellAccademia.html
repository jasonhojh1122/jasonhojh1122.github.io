      <p class="description">The commission for Florence cathedral was originally assigned to Agostino di Duccio with a design by Donatello. When Donatello died, the stone was assigned to Michelangelo. The stone was tall but shallow and some work from Agostino had been done already.

The statue was designed to be placed on the Florence cathedral&#039;s buttress pedestals, on which the boy could look out over the city, gazing to the north. The statue was ultimately placed in front of Palazzo dei Priori (now Palazzo Vecchio).

The left arm and hand were damaged in 1527 and preserved by Vasari and Francesco Salviati. The original now stands in the Galleria dell&#039;Accademia, while a replica stands in its original location in Piazza della Signoria.</p>

      <p class="description">One of a series of 12 apostle statues commissioned for the interior of the Florence Cathedral (Duomo) that was never begun. This unfinished work shows Michelangelo&#039;s sculptural process—the figure appears to be emerging from the block of marble, demonstrating his concept that the sculptor&#039;s task is to liberate the form already present within the stone.</p>
