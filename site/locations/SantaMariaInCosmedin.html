      <p class="description">An important early medieval mosaic fragment housed in the sacristy, originally from the Oratory of Pope John VII in Old St. Peter&#039;s Basilica. The full mosaic cycle measured 9 meters by 6 meters and depicted the Virgin Mary surrounded by seven scenes from her life. This surviving fragment shows the Adoration of the Magi with an angel between the Virgin and Child and the approaching Magi, merging the journey and adoration into a single scene. Donated to the church in 1639 by order of Pope Urban VIII.</p>
